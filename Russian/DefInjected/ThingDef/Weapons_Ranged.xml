<Arrow_Compound_rt.description>This is a bow that uses a levering system, usually of cables and pulleys, to bend the limbs. The pulley/cam system grants the wielder a mechanical advantage, and so the limbs of a compound bow are much stiffer than those of a recurve bow or longbow.</Arrow_Compound_rt.description>
